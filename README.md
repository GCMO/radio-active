# radio-active
This was our final project as a Mob team during the Salt Bootcamp. 

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES:
The App is a tool that collects radio stations streamed online from allover the world. 
It is setup to filter by country and it displays random stations for that country.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
It helps users to access news and music in real-time from any stations world-wide. 
It can also be a useful tool for people learning new languages or improving their 
language proficiency.

We are: Navid Mani Asl, Gabriele Orlandi, Catherine Ã–stlund, Kavitha Sujatha. Among us there is a Materials Engineer, a Math teacher, a Business Development Consultant and a mother of tree launching her career in IT.

    <h5>PROJECT CONCEPT:</h5>
    <p>
      The Project MVP aimed at providing filtered access to World Radio Stations via the radio-browser-api.
    </p>
    <h5>TECH STACK:</h5>
    <p>
      The UI is build with REACT, Styled Components, CSS, Material UI. The SERVER uses NODE.js and EXPRESS. The DataBase is MongoDB which delivers a CRUD, offering users the ability to save their favorite Radio Stations if/when Logged-In. These favorited radio stations are then displayed in a private favorites list. For users that don't want to Register to the site, we provide a Filtering tool, accessing a tailored list of Radio Station by country.

    <p>
      We joined Salt April 2022, after being selected among approx 1500 candidates. We have been MOB programming for 3 months now and this site is the result of our two-week Final Project as a team. We are: Navid Mani Asl, Gabriele Orlandi, Catherine Ã–stlund, Kavitha Sujatha. Among us there is a Materials Engineer, a Math Teacher, a Business Development Consultant and Dental Assistant and we are all excited about our new career in IT.

    <h4>PROJECT CONCEPT</h4>
    <p>
      The Project MVP aimed at providing filtered access to World Radio Stations via the radio-browser-api.
    </p>
    <h4>TECH STACK</h4>
    <p>
      The UI is build with REACT, Styled Components, CSS, Material UI. The SERVER uses NODE.js and EXPRESS.The DataBase is MongoDB which delivers a CRUD, offering users the ability to save their favorite Radio Stations if/when Logged-In. These favorited radio stations are then displayed in a private favorites list. For users that dont want to register to the site, we provide a filtering tool, accessing a tailored list of radio stations by country.
